Monetization Guidelines 
	- The channel having easy monetization process rather than creating a fuss.
	- Compilation videos are hard to monetize 
	- Need proper study for the monetization guidelines


Building a brand
	- The different videos might catch up the subs and some views but won't be regenerating the same results. Instead, get the videos on similar niche, topics, somewhat relevant style like MKBHD, Veratasium. Same intro/outro. Same script style and explanation style that works the best. 
	- In the start, we'll have some different types to see which one catches the best and continue with it
	- Give viewers the reason to come back


Main things:
	- Quality information
	- Quality Production
	- Loyal Following

	How? 
		- Video topics
		- Catchy Scripts
		- Video Edits
		- Thumbnail design



4 Things for Breakthrough

	- Niche is Everything	 (Topics on top now and people will foresee  in future)
	- Quality Content is key. Spending on edits, thumbnails etc for gathering audience
	- Best talent/person for the job
	- No  expectations. Just work


Most Important Step
	- Idea Hunting

	- Thumbnails and Titles to create FOMO (Fear of Missing out) -- Like the videos we see late at night instead of sleeping 
	- Building brand  using thumbnails and titles (similarity showing its you without thinking)
	- Great storytelling (Infotainment)	




More tips:
	- No perfection (it should be good but not everything needs to be perfect)
	- One thing at a time (The channel needs to be focused..)
	- Time/Deadlines
	- Hire once / Hire well
	- Build an audience
	- No expectations





Some Tips (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSQ6Mru88y4):

	- Have old youtube channel (atleast 1 week) (no instant channel for an account)
	- Start posting videos with a number of subscribers around 20-40 subs
	- Give some time after the first youtube short before uploading the next one
